In this course, we'll be covering the basics of Next.js by building out a small example app. Along the way, we'll discuss important features, techniques, and processes to build apps with Next.js.

<br>

Next.js is an incredibly powerful and deep framework. So we won't be covering everything in this course. Check out the other course on [Building a Fullstack app with Next.js, v2][fullstack] and [Production Grade Next.js][production] to learn how to get the best out of this amazing framework.
