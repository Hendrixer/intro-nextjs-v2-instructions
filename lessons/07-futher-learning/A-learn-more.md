Next.js 13 is in beta at the time of this course. This means some things are subject to change. There's also so many things we didn't cover in the course that you should check out. A few of them are:

- Cache revalidating
- Image and Font optimizations
- cookies() and headers()
- Redirecting
- notFound
- Upgrading from older versions [See the Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading#upgrading-from-12-to-13)

<br>

There's also a bunch of production ready optimizations for the things that we did cover. That's outside of the scope for this intro course, but lookout for our production grade course where we will cover those things.
