- cahce revalidating
- Image and Font optimaztions
- cookies() and headers()
- redirecting
- notFound
- upgrading from older versions

There's also a bunch of production ready optimizations for the things that we did cover. That's outside of the scope for this intro course, but lookout for our production grade course where we will cover those things.
