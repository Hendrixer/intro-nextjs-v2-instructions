You might be asking, Why is there a framework built on top of another framework? Well, as amazing as React is for helping us build applications, it&#39;s intentionally missing some things. Things like routing, styling, tooling, and SSR, to name a few. The community has stepped in to create awesome packages for us to build our own frameworks on top of React.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>After years of building apps with React, leading opinions and conventions start to form in the community. You can think if Next.js as a framework that incorporates these ideas. The need to install anything on the framework level is almost nonexistent with Next.js. It&#39;s also a full-stack framework, allowing us to build out server-side logic and APIs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-should-you-use-nextjs\">When should you use Next.js?</h2>\n<p>Next.js is very flexible, with its many different rendering modes, making it ideal for many scenarios. I love to use Next.js for any React-based site/app I am working on for the web. You wouldn&#39;t use Next.js to make a component library or package, as it&#39;s designed to help you build applications.</p>\n","slug":"What-is-Nextjs","title":"What is Next.js","section":"Next.js","icon":"code","filePath":"/home/runner/work/intro-nextjs-v2-instructions/intro-nextjs-v2-instructions/lessons/02-Next.js/B-What-is-Nextjs.md","nextSlug":"/lessons/Next.js/Getting-started","prevSlug":"/lessons/Next.js/Topics-covered"}},"__N_SSG":true}
