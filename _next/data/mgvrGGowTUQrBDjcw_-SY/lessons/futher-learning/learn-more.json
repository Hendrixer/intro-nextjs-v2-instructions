{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{},"html":"<p>Next.js 13 is in beta at the time of this course. This means some things are subject to change. There&#39;s also so many things we didn&#39;t cover in the course that you should check out. A few of them are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cache revalidating</li>\n<li>Image and Font optimizations</li>\n<li>cookies() and headers()</li>\n<li>Redirecting</li>\n<li>notFound</li>\n<li>Upgrading from older versions <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading#upgrading-from-12-to-13\">See the Docs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also a bunch of production ready optimizations for the things that we did cover. That&#39;s outside of the scope for this intro course, but lookout for our production grade course where we will cover those things.</p>\n","slug":"learn-more","title":"Learn More","section":"Futher Learning","icon":"info-circle","filePath":"/home/runner/work/intro-nextjs-v2-instructions/intro-nextjs-v2-instructions/lessons/07-futher-learning/A-learn-more.md","nextSlug":null,"prevSlug":"/lessons/Styling/css-modules"}},"__N_SSG":true}
